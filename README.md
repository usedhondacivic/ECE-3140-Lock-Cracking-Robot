### Project Description

We plan to make a reaction time game similar to Piano Tiles. Music will play and players will need to press one of the two buttons on the board in time with the beat. The an LED will also light up to indicate when the button needs to be pressed. 
### Technical Approach

We plan on just using the KL46Z board and a computer connected to it in order to play the music. We plan to use UART to send a signal to the board whenever a beat is played and when to signal that a button needs to be pressed. We plan to use the LED and button functionality of the KL46Z.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ajx8-mw773-vmf24" then the GitHub page is at "https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ajx8-mw773-vmf24" You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
