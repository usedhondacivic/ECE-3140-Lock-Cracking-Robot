### Project Description

There was a very popular game named "Plane Wars", a more popular version is the 1945 Air Force. The game was very simple and entertaining. You are operating an aircraft to dodge the planes flying towards you and you can also shoot them to eliminate them. The one we are to accomplish is a more vintage and 2D version of the old game. The plane can only move along one axis and shoot the planes.
### Technical Approach

In order to control the plane, we are now thinking of three ways to do it:

1. Use the two buttons on the FRDM board to control the aircraft to move left or right

2. Use the accelerometer to control the aircraft by tilting the board

3. By swiping on the touch screen to control the plane to move.

If possible we would like to implement more than one way to control it. Currently, we prefer the accelerometer method.

The Plane War GUI would be created by Python, especially using Pygame to build out the GUI. Pyserial is used to interact with the serial port. To use the values from the accelerometer via a USB connection. The value would be translated into the actual action of the plane and change the GUI correspondingly.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/js2969-pm555" then the GitHub page is at "https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/js2969-pm555" You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
