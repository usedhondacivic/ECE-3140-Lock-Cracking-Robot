<p>The CNC Master Lock Cracker (who I call Clicky) is a robot designed to efficiently find the combination to any master lock brand combination lock.
These are the classic locks you probably associate with your high school locker.
First, place the lock in the lock holder and ensure the dial manipulator is seated on the dial.
Rotate the dial so that the lock is at 0, then press the button on the microcontroller.
Clicky will begin speedily trying combinations, go make some coffee and come back to an unlocked lock!</p>

<a id="hardware" class="anchor" href="#hardware" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hardware</h4>
<p>Clicky's body is made from clear laser cut acrylic, housing the electronics that make him work. A NEMA 17 stepper motor rotates the dial and an analog feedback servo is used to pull on the shackle and determine if the lock has been opened. All of the electronics are driven through a custom circuit board powered by a wall outlet.</p>

<a id="software" class="anchor" href="#software" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Software</h4>
<p>I wrote custom stepper and analog servo drivers to control Clicky, as well a library for using the buttons and capacitive touch slider on the FRDM-KL46Z to control a LCD based UI. I also implemented the cracking algorithm, which has two modes: naïve and advanced. Naïve mode requires no input from the user, and simply tries every combination in order until the lock opens. Unfortunately, this can take upwards of 64,000 attempts which takes around 36 hours. This time is improved by using advanced mode, which requires the user to find and enter three binding points on the lock. Using advanced mode, the number of combinations is dropped down to 8, which can be attempted in under 30 seconds.</p>

<a id="hardware-1" class="anchor" href="#hardware-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hardware</h4>
<p>The main drivers of Clicky are the NEMA 17 stepper motor and the analog feedback servo motor.</p>
<p>The quintessential requirement of combination cracking is turning the dial. For this job I chose a stepper motor. Stepper motors are easy to control, fast, and accurate. Steppers are controlled in discrete "steps", each constituting a consistent percentage of a rotation. For the stepper I chose, this was 200 steps per rotation. Given that a master lock has 40 positions, this gives a resolution of 5 steps per number on the lock.</p>
<p>To open the shackle, and I needed a high torque motor that I could control positionally. A standard hobby servo meets these requirements perfectly, but I also needed to determine if the shackle did in fact open. An analog feedback servo offers an feedback signal reporting the actual position of the arm, allowing me to check if the servo was able to pull the shackle out of the lock.</p>
<p>Once I decided on the components I wanted to use, I was time to build the body of the robot. I used a CAD program named OnShape to design the parts for Clicky. The parts were then either 3D printed in PLA or laser cut from 3/16" acrylic, and assembled using screws. The end result is a clean transparent look with red and pink highlights.</p>
<p>Next, I need to power the electronics. Clicky uses a custom circuit board to provide a central source of power and control. Power is supplied from a 12V 2A wall adapter, which provides direct power to the stepper motor. I also used a 6V step down to provide power for the FRDM-KL46Z and the servo motor. Due to the nature of the motors I used, voltage spikes are unavoidable during operation. To prevent these spikes from disrupting the power to the FRDM-KL46Z, I added a 100 microfarad capacitor across the supply lines. To control the stepper motor, I used Allegro’s A4988 stepper driver. This allowed for use of my 2A stepper motor at full power, and supplied an simple control scheme for direction and position. Finally, I routed all of the signal, power, and ground connections to a central bus that is broken out to connect to the FRDM-KL46Z with minimal lose wires.</p>
