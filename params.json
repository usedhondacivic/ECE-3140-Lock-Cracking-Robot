{"name":"CNC Master Lock Cracker","tagline":"For all your cracking needs","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\n### System Overview\r\n\r\nThe CNC Master Lock Cracker is a robot designed to efficiently find the combination to any master lock.\r\nFirst, place the lock in the lock holder and ensure the dial manipulator is seated on the dial.\r\nRotate the dial so that the lock is at 0, then press the button on the microcontroller.\r\nThe lock cracker will begin trying combinations, go make some coffee and come back to find it unlocked.\r\n\r\n#### Progress to date:\r\n\r\nI have completed all of the hardware and wiring for the project, and have written the stepper driver.\r\nIt currently can unlock a lock when given its combination, but I still need to write the servo driver to automatically pull the shackle before brute forcing can begin.\r\n\r\n### Project Video Demo\r\n\r\n### Technical Description\r\n\r\n### Additional Resources Used\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
